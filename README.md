# Skill development with Ruby on Rails

Through my experience developing this website, I learned and practiced a lot of technical skills including implementation of static pages, introduction of dynamic elements, user database development and design of form. Furthermore, I practiced programming in Ruby and common software development techniques such as HTML and SCSS. Working with Ruby on Rails, I learned to work with Gems and utilized proper Gems to facilitate development process. In addition, I formed good software design habits of developing consistent header and footer as well as using harmonious color scheme throughout the website. As a website designer, I mastered good designing principles of combining textual and pictorial information, selecting visually appealing font type and font size, and leaving out sufficient whitespace to provide the users with a better experience of using the website.
